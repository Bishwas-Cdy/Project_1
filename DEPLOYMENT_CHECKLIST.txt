 THIS PACKAGE IS 100% STANDALONE!
   - No training code needed
   - No dataset required
   - Just copy this folder and go!

Option 1: Zip and Send (Recommended)
-------------------------------------
1. Go to parent directory:
   cd /home/bishwas/Documents/Project_1

2. Create zip file:
   zip -r ranjana_deployment.zip DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE/

3. Share ranjana_deployment.zip with your teammates
   - Size: ~122 MB
   - Use Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or WeTransfer

Option 2: Git Repository
-------------------------
1. The DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE already has .git initialized!
   cd DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE

2. Push to GitHub/GitLab:
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production-ready Ranjana model - verified"
   git push -u origin main

3. Share repository link with teammates

Option 3: Direct Copy
---------------------
1. Copy entire DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE/ folder to USB drive
2. Give to teammates directly
3. They just need to pip install -r requirements.txt

================================================================================
                  WHAT YOUR TEAMMATES NEED
================================================================================

That's it! No training needed, no additional downloads.

================================================================================
                    QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

For your teammates who want to get started immediately:

Step 1: Install Dependencies
-----------------------------
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Test the Models
-----------------------
python examples/example_basic_usage.py

Step 3: Read the Integration Guide
-----------------------------------
Read: documentation/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.txt
  - Shows how to integrate with Flutter
  - Shows how to integrate with Django
  - Shows how to create REST API

Step 4: Choose Integration Method
----------------------------------
Option A: Python Backend (Recommended for beginners)
  - Use example_flask_api.py as starting point
  - Flutter app calls API endpoints
  - Models run on server

Option B: On-Device (Advanced)
  - Convert models to TFLite
  - Integrate directly in Flutter app
  - See INTEGRATION_GUIDE.txt for conversion steps

================================================================================
                      IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. CLASS MAPPING:
   - Folders are numbered 1-62
   - Model outputs 0-61
   - ALWAYS add 1 to model output!
   - Example: Model predicts 15 -> Folder is 16

2. IMAGE PREPROCESSING:
   - Images MUST be 64×64 pixels (automatic)
   - Images MUST be grayscale (automatic)
   - Images MUST be normalized with mean=0.2611, std=0.4186 (automatic)
   - inference.py handles all this automatically!

3. GRAD-CAM:
   - Does NOT need training
   - Uses the classification model internally
   - Just a visualization technique

4. MODEL FILES:
   - DO NOT modify .pth files
   - DO NOT rename .pth files
   - Keep models/ directory structure as-is

5. PERFORMANCE:
   - CPU is sufficient for real-time inference
   - GPU makes it 10x faster (optional)
   - Use batch processing for multiple images

================================================================================
                        FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

THINGS YOUR TEAMMATES DON'T NEED:
   Training data (not included, not needed)
   Training scripts (not included, not needed)
   Jupyter notebooks (not included, not needed)
   Additional model checkpoints (only best models included)
   GPU (optional, but makes it faster)

THINGS YOUR TEAMMATES SHOULD KNOW:
   Models are trained and final
   No retraining required
   Just use inference.py for everything
   Read the documentation first
   Start with the examples

BACKUP RECOMMENDATION:
  - Keep a backup of this package
  - Models took hours to train!
  - Don't lose the .pth files

SUPPORT:
  - Your teammates can contact you (Bishwas) if stuck
  - Point them to documentation/ first
  - Most answers are in TROUBLESHOOTING.txt
